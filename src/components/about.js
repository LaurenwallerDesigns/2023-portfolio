        <p>I am a Freelance Frontend Developer. Based in Alabama.
        <br />
        <br />
        Having made websites for podcasts, fitness trainers and small businesses.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am eager to join a team of other developers. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Previously, I worked as an Adminstrative Assistant for a mid-sized company in Florida. 
        <br />
        <br />
        While at the company, I created a new plan and got all 400 employees up-to-date on all Federal and Regional requirements for their jobs. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I pride myself on my inventive thinking and creative problem solving skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        I use those same skills in Web Development. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Always coming up with new and creative ways to find solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Besides coding, I am a mom of three. A military wife and an avid audiobook listener.<br /> Last year I read 125 books, this year my goal is 150.
